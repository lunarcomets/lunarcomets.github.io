    <p>hiya! lunarcomets speaking (usually just going by lunar), you probably know me from one of the characters i play and everything in relation to them, 
    some aspect of the space station community, or just randomly found yourself on my page! no matter <em>where</em>
    you've come from, i bid you welcome!</p>

    <p>this is my personal little corner of the internet, where i'm going to be compiling lots of different things such
    as characters and their given lore and art, personal projects, thoughts on various things, and more! overall: this
    is a compendium of things i like, meant to help me get familiarized with making a website!</p>

    <p>use the navbar above to navigate this place, and have fun exploring!</p>
